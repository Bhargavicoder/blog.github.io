            <h1><strong>Introduction:-</strong></h1>
            <p class=basic>Before going into the concept there are some basic questions you must know.</p>
            <p class="q">What is multitasking?</p>
            <div class="ans">
                <ul >
                    <li>Executing several tasks simeltaneously is the concept of multi tasking.</li>
                    <li>There are  two types of multitasking</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Process Based Multitasking

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Thread Based Multitasking
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Process Based Multitasking:-</li>

                    Executing several tasks simeltaneously where each task is a seperate independent program is called process based multitasking.
                    <br>ex:- While typing a java program in the editor we can listen audio songs from same system at the same time we can download a file from internet . All this tasks will be executed simeltaneously and independent of each other. Hence it is process based multitasking .Process based multitasking is best suitable at OS level .

                            Thread Based Multitasking:-
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <div class="ans2">
                    Executing several tasks simeltaneously where each task is a seperate independent task of same program is called thread  based multitasking.

                    Application areas of multithreading:-<br>1)To develop multimedia graphics <br>
                    2)To devolop animations <br>
                    3)To devolop video games<br>
                    4)To devolop webservers and application servers<br>
